## TODO
 - deduct weight if the piece is on the original position
 - if in end game give extra weight for king to move forward
 - introduce some endgame knowledge such as rooks on the same file or same row
 - introduce openings from a predefine database


## Improvements 
 - Move ordering (if a move is a capture it should be evaluated first)
